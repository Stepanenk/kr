        "Lead,Follow,or Get Out of the Way" was the title of a 1981<br>
        biography of Ted Turner,who also had the saying on a plaque on<br>
        his desk.

        In life there are leaders or at times it is you who must take the<br>
        role of leader. Another option in life is to follow the leader.<br>
        Nothing is wrong with being a follower,and if this is your role in a<br>
        situation. And finally,there are leaders and followers as well as<br>
        those who just seem to get in the way. People who get in the<br>
        way choose not to lead or to follow but slow the progress of an<br>
        individual or group that is striving towards a goal. This quote has<br>
        helped me in life and business.
